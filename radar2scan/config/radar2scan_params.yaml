    # For exactly 61 rays with ceil() calculation:
    # We need: ceil((angle_max - angle_min) / angle_increment) = 61

    # Range limits (in meters)
    range_min: 0.1   # Minimum detection range

    # Frame ID for the laser scan
    # Should match your TF tree configuration

    # Intensity filtering
    # Enable this to publish only high intensity points

    intensity_threshold: 25.0       # Minimum intensity value to keep (adjust based on your sensor)
    
    # GPU Acceleration (CUDA support enabled!)
    # Use CUDA GPU for processing to minimize CPU usage
    # Falls back to optimized CPU (OpenMP) if GPU is not available

    # Size of the dummy box around each detected point (in meters)
